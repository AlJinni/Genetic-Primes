# Genetic-Primes
This is fun program to destroy your computer productively while generating huge Klaub(b)er primes.

IN OTHER WORDS
It finds polynomial functions with low prime density and subracts a list of them 
from a prime-rich rich list, evolving to maximize the non-primes in the list. 

The eventual goal of this project is to generate prime numbers in polynomial time without having to check the species of number generated.
